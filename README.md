This is my first ASP.NET project which I developed to learn it. Most parts of webapp is written by hands with a point of learning how the web works. Services I wrote myself: session manager, password-salting-and-hashing service, 'authentithication without sending password to server' service, antispam service, document search service, frequent-search-requests service which can return results of most popular search requests without quering the DB. All of services with settings can be adjusted by changing appsettings.json, I tried to avoid hard-coding. There is multiple levels of abstrantions, therefore every service has settings-provider which works with json files, so service itself will work only with C# variables. I learned working with MOQ for testing those services. I used many partialviews and some viewcomponent to make components transitive between webpages.
